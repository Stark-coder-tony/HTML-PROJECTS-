                    Sakura Uchiha (うちはサクラ, Uchiha Sakura, née Haruno (春野)) is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. When assigned
                    to Team 7, Sakura quickly finds herself ill-prepared for the duties of a shinobi. However, after
                    training under the Sannin Tsunade, she overcomes this, and becomes recognised as one of the greatest
                    medical-nin in the world.

                <h2 class="name">Background</h2>
                <p class="aboutchars">
                    Born into the famed Uzumaki clan of Uzushiogakure, Kushina lived most of her youth being caught up
                    in war, making her seek for a daily peace. At a young age she was sent to Konoha and enrolled in the
                    Academy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sakura is the only child of Mebuki and Kizashi Haruno. She had an ordinary childhood, raised by her
                    parents without any serious tragedy or complications, unlike her team members. When she entered
                    Konoha's Academy, a few of the girls in her class started picking on her because of her broad
                    forehead. Sakura tried to combat their teasing by hiding her forehead with her bangs, but this
                    proved to the other girls that it bothered her and caused them to tease her even more. Ino Yamanaka,
                    one of her classmates, saw this, and defended Sakura from her bullies and encouraged her to embrace
                    her forehead rather than hide it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the following years, Ino's guidance and friendship helped Sakura become comfortable with
                    herself and develop into her own person. Though she felt indebted to Ino for helping her, Sakura
                    began to feel that she was living in Ino's shadow when she, instead, wanted to be Ino's equal. At
                    some point after she entered in the Academy, Sakura met Sasuke Uchiha and she developed a crush on
                    him. When she told her friends, she was surprised to learn how popular Sasuke was with the girls.
                    Sakura heard a rumour of Sasuke being attracted to girls with long hair and she began letting her
                    hair grow to get his attention.
