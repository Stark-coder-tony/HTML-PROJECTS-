                <p class="aboutchars">
                    Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the
                    jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most
                    of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the
                    village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years,
                    through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the
                    villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf
                    (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved
                    to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his
                    dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh
                    Fire Shadow).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina
                    Uzumaki (the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails). He was named after Naruto Musasabi, the
                    protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the Sannin his godfather.[14] The Third Hokage made
                    special arrangements for Minato to preserve Kushina's seal containing the Nine-Tails while she gave
                    birth to Naruto in a remote location, assisted by midwives and Anbu. A masked man, Tobi, tracked
                    down their location, however, killed the midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to
                    quickly rescue him and teleport him to a safe house.
