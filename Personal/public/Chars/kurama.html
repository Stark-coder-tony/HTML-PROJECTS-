                <p class="aboutchars">
                    Kurama was the Nine Tail Beast whose jinchuriki was Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto's positive attitude
                    despite all that he suffered over the course of his life finally convinces Kurama to help Naruto.
                    Not only that, the he also, alongside Naruto, use his power not for destruction but to help the
                    world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kurama is cynical, proud, foxy, cunning, and manipulative, his ideal he is the most powerful Tailed
                    Beast causing him and the Tailed Beasts to go their separate ways after their creator died. Kurama
                    hates and distrusts humans, a trait shared by the other Tailed Beasts save Gyuki as they were
                    captured and considered nothing more than tools for the humans' fight among themselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kurama was born towards the end of the Sage of the Six Paths, who used his power to take the
                    Ten-Tails' chakra from its body and divide it into the nine tailed beasts to ensure that when he was
                    gone, none would ever possess it. Some time afterwards, the Sage told Kurama and the others that
                    they would always be together, even apart. He also said they would one day become one again with new
                    names and forms, when they understood true power. As the centuries passed, Kurama would come to be
                    considered an ancient force of nature, suddenly appearing in places where the darkest aspects of
                    humanity festered and wipe them out.
