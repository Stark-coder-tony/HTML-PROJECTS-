                <p class="aboutchars">
                    Kushina Uzumaki (うずまきクシナ, Uzumaki Kushina) was a Konohagakure kunoichi who originated from
                    Uzushiogakure's Uzumaki clan. She was the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails.

                </p>
                <h2 class="name">Background</h2>
                <p class="aboutchars">
                    Born into the famed Uzumaki clan of Uzushiogakure, Kushina lived most of her youth being caught up
                    in war, making her seek for a daily peace. At a young age she was sent to Konoha and enrolled in the
                    Academy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Wanting to make a strong first impression, she proclaimed to her class that she would be the first
                    female Hokage. The other kids laughed at her statement, and began calling her "Tomato" (トマト) because
                    of her then-round face and fiery red hair. This prompted her to lash out and pummel the kids who
                    teased her. This, in addition to her red hair flying wildly around her as she did so, earned her the
                    nickname of Red Hot-Blooded Habanero (赤い血潮のハバネロ, "Akai Chishio no Habanero", Viz: Red-Hot Habanero).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kushina was eventually told why she had to leave her home of Uzushio and go to Konoha; because of
                    her special chakra, she was to be the next jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.[6] Kushina was
                    terrified by the idea, but she was comforted by the Nine-Tails' then-current jinchūriki, Mito
                    Uzumaki. Before the transfer was performed, Mito advised Kushina that love was the only way to tame
                    the Nine-Tails and overcome its hate.
